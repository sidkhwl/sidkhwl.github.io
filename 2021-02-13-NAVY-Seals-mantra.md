I recently came across this quote, somewhere on Twitter, attributed to the Navy seals, atleast in the current form.

> Under pressure, you don't rise to the occasion, you sink to the level of your training

Literature on the web suggests it is a derivative of the original quote -

> We don't rise to the level of our expectations, we fall to the level of our training - Archilochus

Nevertheless, both of them convey the same thing. The quote tells a great deal about a soldier's mindset. The mindset they develop after going through the rigorous training at the Navy.

Can this however be applied at other places too? In other contexts. Say is it as much applicable on to someone in arts as it is to a surgeon?
