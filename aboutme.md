I am completing my final semester at BITS Pilani pursuing a B.E. in Computer Science.

Currently I'm dabbling with competitive programming. I practice mostly at [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/sidkhwl/), will be switching to [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/profile/ahfod) soon.

I will be joining [Samsung R&D Institute Bangalore](https://research.samsung.com/sri-b) as a Software Engineer after graduation.

I have worked at a fast-growing startup, and an MNC as a Software Engineer Intern.
Currently building a Computer vision based ITMS system inspired by the VisionZero ideology. Landing page under construction.
Python, C++, JavaScript, Java are languages I code in, in order of preference.

I have projects in Web Development, Machine Learning. Pinned repositores [here](https://github.com/siddhantkhandelwal) exemplify.
